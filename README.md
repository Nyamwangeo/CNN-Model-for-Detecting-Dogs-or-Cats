In this project, I built an image classification model using TensorFlow to differentiate between images of cats and dogs. I utilized a dataset of 10,000 images, evenly split between cats and dogs, and prepared the data by resizing the images and normalizing pixel values. The dataset was divided into an 80:20 train-test split, with 8,000 images used for training and 2,000 for testing. The model architecture was a convolutional neural network (CNN) consisting of convolutional layers with ReLU activation, max-pooling, a flattening layer, and fully connected layers, culminating in a sigmoid output layer for binary classification.
The model was trained over 20 epochs using the Adam optimizer, with binary crossentropy as the loss function, and achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set. During training, I monitored performance using validation data and applied early stopping techniques to prevent overfitting. Post-training, I evaluated the model using accuracy scores and a confusion matrix, which provided further insights into its effectiveness in distinguishing between cat and dog images. The overall performance demonstrated strong model accuracy, confirming the CNNâ€™s ability to learn the features of the dataset effectively.
Throughout this project, I strengthened my skills in deep learning, image processing, and model evaluation, particularly within the TensorFlow framework. By implementing data preprocessing techniques and exploring various hyperparameter settings, I gained deeper insights into the importance of optimizing model architecture and training procedures. Additionally, the project gave me hands-on experience with real-world data handling, model tuning, and evaluation, solidifying my understanding of machine learning processes from end to end.
